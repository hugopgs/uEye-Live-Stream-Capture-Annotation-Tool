# uEye Live Stream Capture & Annotation Tool

This Python script provides a **live video stream** interface for **IDS uEye cameras**, with interactive measurement and image capture capabilities. It allows you to:

* View a real-time stream from the connected uEye camera.
* Draw and measure distances directly on the live image using your mouse.
* Capture frames as images.
* Optionally annotate captured images with custom text before saving.

---

## üß© Features

* **Live stream** from IDS uEye camera.
* **Mouse interaction**:

  * Click two points to draw a red measurement line.
  * Displays the distance between points in **pixels** and **microns** (5.3 ¬µm/pixel scale).
* **Keyboard controls**:

  * **P** ‚Üí Capture current frame (and optionally annotate it).
  * **C** ‚Üí Clear drawn measurement line.
  * **Q** or **ESC** ‚Üí Quit live stream.
* **Image saving**:

  * Captured images are saved as `capture_###.png` in the output folder.
  * A second annotated version (with optional text) is also saved automatically.
* **Text annotation window** appears after capture, allowing you to type custom labels.

## üß† Requirements

### Hardware

* IDS uEye camera (connected and configured properly).

### Software

* Python 3.8+
* Required Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install pyueye numpy opencv-python
  ```

### Optional

* `.ini` configuration file for camera settings (can be passed as `ini_path=True` to load from default).

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Connect your uEye camera** to your computer.

2. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python ueye_live_capture.py
   ```

3. **Keyboard shortcuts during live stream**:

   | Key         | Action                |
   | ----------- | --------------------- |
   | **P**       | Capture current frame |
   | **C**       | Clear drawn line      |
   | **Q / ESC** | Quit live stream      |

4. **Mouse controls**:

   * **Left-click twice** to draw a measurement line.
   * The distance appears in pixels and microns on the live image.

5. **When capturing (P)**:

   * A small window appears where you can type annotation text.
   * Press **ENTER** to confirm, or **ESC** to skip.

## üìÅ Output

By default, images are saved in the `data/` or `captures/` directory as:

```
capture_001.png
capture_001.png_annotated.png
```

You can change the output folder with the parameter:

```python
live_stream_with_capture(cam_id=2, ini_path=True, output_dir="my_images")
```

## Notes

* If `is_InitCamera` fails, check your uEye driver installation.
* If the `.ini` file cannot be loaded, the program will continue with default settings.
* Measurement scaling (`5.3 ¬µm/pixel`) can be modified in the code depending on your setup.
